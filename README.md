# Parking_system
LOW LEVEL DESIGN OF PARKING SYSTEM----------->>>>>>>|
   
1-->REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS::->
    ▪︎ PARKING_SLOT
       In my program I contain parking slot which is at the parking area and each parking slot 
       contains some rows in which the car should be parked and there is spotnumber also and one
       level attribute and car attribute also.
    ▪︎ LEVEL
       This basically shows the levels because the today the parking system is changed as there are different 
       levels at which the parking should be done
    ▪︎ AVAILABLE_SLOT
       We have to also check whether the particular slot available in the parking area or not
       Because it will ensure that the slot is empty and any car should be parked there at a time.
